# Lung Cancer Prediction API with Makefile Automation (FastAPI + MLflow)

This project provides an automated pipeline for training and deploying a lung cancer prediction model using **Gradient Boosting**, **FastAPI**, and **MLflow**. A Makefile is included to streamline environment setup, model training, prediction, and cleanup.

---

## Features

* **Makefile Automation**
  Simplifies setup, training, prediction, and cleanup through terminal commands.

* **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
  A robust and accurate model for lung cancer classification.

* **FastAPI REST API**
  Lightweight, high-performance backend for model interaction.

* **MLflow Tracking**
  Automatically logs experiments, parameters, metrics, and models.

* **Data Preprocessing**
  Includes cleaning, feature extraction, and class imbalance correction.

## Makefile Commands (Windows Instructions)

Ensure you are using a terminal with `make` support (e.g., Git Bash).

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
make init
```

Creates a virtual environment, upgrades `pip`, and installs required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

### 2. Run the API Server

```bash
make run
```

Starts the FastAPI development server using Uvicorn.

### 3. Train the Model (with MLflow tracking)

```bash
make train
```

Sends a `POST` request to the `/api/train` endpoint. MLflow will automatically track:

* Hyperparameters
* Accuracy and metrics
* Model artifact

Optional arguments can be set by modifying the `Makefile`:

* `DATA_PATH`: Path to the dataset CSV file
* `MODEL_PATH`: Output path for the trained model

You can launch the MLflow UI using:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

Then visit: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### 4. Make a Prediction

```bash
make predict
```

Sends a `POST` request to the `/api/predict` endpoint using default or customized features.

To use custom features, modify the `FEATURES` variable in the Makefile:

```bash
FEATURES = "[55, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1]"
```

### 5. Clean Environment

```bash
make clean
```

Removes:

* `venv/`
* `__pycache__/`

---

## API Endpoints

### 1. Train Model

* **Endpoint**: `/api/train`
* **Method**: `POST`
* **Request Body**:

```json
{
  "data_path": "data/survey_lung_cancer.csv",
  "model_save_path": "models/best_gboost_model.pkl"
}
```

* **Response**:

```json
{
  "message": "Model trained successfully",
  "result": {
    "accuracy": 0.9375,
    "best_params": {
      "learning_rate": 0.01,
      "max_depth": 3,
      "n_estimators": 200
    }
  }
}
```

✅ This training process is tracked via **MLflow**, which logs:

* Parameters (`learning_rate`, `max_depth`, etc.)
* Accuracy
* Serialized model

### 2. Make Prediction

* **Endpoint**: `/api/predict`
* **Method**: `POST`
* **Request Body**:

```json
{
  "model_path": "models/best_gboost_model.pkl",
  "features": [60, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2]
}
```

* **Response**:

```json
{
  "prediction": [1],
  "result_label": "Present"
}
```

## Dataset Format

Your CSV dataset must include the following columns:

* `AGE`
* `GENDER`
* `SMOKING`
* `ANXIETY`
* `YELLOW_FINGERS`
* `PEER_PRESSURE`
* `CHRONIC DISEASES`
* `FATIGUE`
* `ALLERGY`
* `WHEEZING`
* `ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION`
* `COUGHING`
* `LUNG_CANCER` (Target: 0 = Absent, 1 = Present)

---

## Manual Setup (Without Makefile)

1. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment (Windows):

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the server:

```bash
uvicorn run:app --reload
```

5. (Optional) Run MLflow UI:

```bash
mlflow ui
```
